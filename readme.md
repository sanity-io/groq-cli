# groq-cli

_Currently in alpha._

> Easy wrangling of JSON documents with [GROQ](https://github.com/sanity-io/groq) in the command line.

The CLI tool consumes both JSON and [NDJSON](https://github.com/ndjson/ndjson-spec)) documents. You can pass in data from a local file, or from piping to standard input.

Read the [announcement blog post](https://www.sanity.io/blog/we-re-open-sourcing-groq-a-query-language-for-json-documents), and the [getting started guide](https://www.sanity.io/docs/data-store/how-queries-work).

## Install

```bash
npm install --global groq-cli
```

## Requirements

This CLI requires Node v18 or later.

## Usage

```bash
$ groq --help
  Run GROQ in the command line

  Usage
    $ groq '*[<filter>]{<projection>}'
    # Remember to alternate quotation marks inside of the query

  Options
    -i, --input   One of: ndjson, json, null
    -o, --output  One of: ndjson, json, pretty, type-nodes
    -p, --pretty  Shortcut for --output=pretty
    -n, --ndjson  Shortcut for --input=ndjson --output=ndjson
    -s, --schema  Path to a schema file, only required when output is set to "type-nodes"

  Input formats
    json      Reads a JSON object from stdin.
    ndjson    Reads a JSON stream from stdin.
    null      Reads nothing.

  Output formats
    json      Formats the output as JSON.
    pretty    Formats the output as pretty JSON.
    ndjson    Streams the result as NDJSON.

  Examples
    # Query data in a file
    $ cat blog.json | groq 'count(posts)'

    # Query data in a NDJSON file
    $ cat blog.ndjson | groq --input ndjson '*[_type == "post"]{title}'

    # Query JSON data from an URL
    $ curl -s https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos | groq  --pretty '*[completed == false]{title}'
```
